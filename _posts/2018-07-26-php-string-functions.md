title: PHP String Functions
---

PHP has a wide array of built-in functions that can be used when working with strings. Think of a function as a tool that can take something as an input and returns an output.

Here's a list of the commonly used ones:

+ `strtolower()` - Converts a string to lowercase, e.g. `echo strtolower('Hello World');` which will output `hello world`;
+ `strtoupper()` - Converts a string to uppercase, e.g. `echo strtolower('Hello World');` which will output `HELLO WORLD`;
+ `ucfirst()` - Converts the first letter of a string to uppercase, e.g. `echo ucfirst('this is a string');` which will output `This is a string`;
+ `ucwords()` -  Converts the first letter of every word in a string to uppercase, e.g. `echo ucwords('this is a string');` which will output `This Is A String`;
