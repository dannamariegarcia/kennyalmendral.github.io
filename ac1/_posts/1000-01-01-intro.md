## My Art Camp 1 Journey

Drawing and some painting have been my hobbies when I was a child, but it came to a halt when I graduated from high school.

Fast forward 7 years at the age of 25, I decided to pick it up again. I'm currently enrolled in [Noah Bradley's Art Camp 1](https://artcamp.com/){:target="_blank"} which is a 12 week self-directed online course and I'm going to document my progress along the way...
